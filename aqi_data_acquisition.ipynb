    "The objective of this notebook is to collect historical Air Quality Index (AQI) data for [Madison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pHLA9XzXoy9nJTaiNkgThGPQjVEa0tfeH203I6FA238/edit?gid=0#gid=0&range=E55), located in [Dane County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dane_County,_Wisconsin), [Wisconsin](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pHLA9XzXoy9nJTaiNkgThGPQjVEa0tfeH203I6FA238/edit?gid=0#gid=0&range=F55) starting from 1964 to 2024, for dates ranging from May 1st to October 31st.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) API, which focuses on historical data rather than real-time air quality information. The API [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) provides detailed explanations of the various parameters used in API calls and includes examples of how to retrieve data. For more information about the Air Quality System, refer to the [EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Air Quality Index measures the air quality on a given day, indicating how safe or polluted the air is. It tracks common pollutants such as smog, smoke and carbon monoxide. A rating between 0 and 50 reflects clean, healthy air, while the index value of 301 or above represents hazardous conditions. A comprehensive explanation of AQI calculation is available [here](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "To locate nearby air quality monitoring stations, Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes are required for the specific city, county, and state. The FIPS data for this notebook was sourced from [federal communications commission](https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt). I am using the county level FIPS code for Madison.\n",

The monitoring system is complex and changes all the time. The EPA implementation allows an API user to find changes to monitoring sites and sensors by making requests - maybe monthly, or daily. This API approach is probably better than having the EPA publish documentation that may be out of date as soon as it hits a web page. Some of the responses rely on jargon or terms-of-art.

Next for each record in the dataframe, we retrieve the pollutant concentration value and check if this is in one of the defined breakpoint ranges. If yes we calculate AQI as follows and rounded it to nearest value to match with the exisitng value type.\n",
