# DATA 512:  Part 1 - Common Analysis

## Wildland Fire Impacts on Madison, WI

### Project Overview

Summers in the western U.S. are becoming more and more known for wildfires, with smoke spreading to many states. There are several reasons for this, including climate change, U.S. forestry policies, and increased awareness of the problem. No matter what causes the fires, they have a wide impact because wildfire smoke lowers air quality in many cities. More studies are showing that smoke can have negative effects on health, tourism, property, and many other areas of society.

The main goal of this project is to closely study the effects of wildfire smoke on Madison, WI to provide practical insights that can help various interested groups. First, we will look at past wildfire data to estimate how much smoke has reached the city in recent years and compare with AQI values for Madison city. Using this information, we build a predictive model to predict smoke patterns that Madison might experience over the next 25 years.

#### Access Key
To use AQI related API we need to request a key using a valid email address. The EPA then sends a confirmation email link and a 'key' that we use for all other requests.
We only need to sign-up once, unless we want to invalidate the current key (by getting a new key) or we lose the key. Refer to the notebook [2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb) for additional information.

### Project Workflow

- [1_wildfire_data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/1_wildfire_data_acquisition.ipynb)

This notebook reads the wildland fire dataset from USGS, calculates the distance from Madison for each fire, filters the data for years 1964 - 2024 and generates the two csv files with selected columns. One for all the fires between the mentioned dates and one for the fires occured between these dates but within 650 mile radius from Madison.

- [2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb)

This notebook is used to fetch AQI data from API, clean the data, calculate missing APIs and finally generated a csv file of yearly AQI estimates for years 1964 - 2024.

- [3_smoke_estimation.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/3_smoke_estimation.ipynb)

This notebook utilises the files generated by the above notebooks to calculate smoke estimates and compare with AQI data to validate the calculated smoke estimates.
- [4_predictive_model.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/4_predictive_model.ipynb)

This notebook is used to build a predictive model on smoke estimates to forecast smoke estimates for next 25 years.

- [5_visualizations.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/5_visualizations.ipynb)

This notebook is used to analyse the data generated so far through visuals. It generated the three specific visulas as mentioned under output files.

### Limitations/Considerations.

- The Listed_fire_Dates includes all individual dates from merged datasets that overlap in the same area and year. This can provide more details but also adds variation and possible duplication, especially when multiple sources are involved making it unreliable.
- The tool used to measure fire distances works only with ring-shaped fire boundaries, so 36 fires with curve ring shapes failed while calculating distance and not included in analysis.
- AQI was missing for many records, which were recalculated using the available pollutants data. This adds some level of uncertainity to the calculated value.
- AQI data is very sparse for years 2001 to 2009 leading poor qualirt average. This makes it difficult to compare and asses out calculation of smoke estimates for this period.
- The predictive model has R^2 value of only 0.71 which means the model explains about 71% of the variation in the data, there is still a lot of room for improvement in the model. Additionally the predicted values could be off by atleast 2 units which is significantly high for our scale of smoke estimates. While this is a fairly good model considering the data availability limitaion, this is not the best model to forecast the smoke estimate.
