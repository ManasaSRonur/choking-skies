# Analysis of Wildfire Smoke and Its Impact on Respiratory Health of Madison, WI

### Project Overview

Summers in the western U.S. are becoming more and more known for wildfires, with smoke spreading to many states. There are several reasons for this, including climate change, US forestry policies, and increased awareness of the problem. No matter what causes the fires, they have a wide impact because wildfire smoke lowers air quality in many cities. More studies are showing that smoke can have negative effects on health, especially respiratory health.

From a scientific perspective, understanding the health consequences of wildfire-induced smoke provides crucial insights into the direct impact of climate-related events on respiratory health. Practically, these findings can guide public health interventions, informing policies that protect vulnerable populations, especially during peak wildfire seasons. By integrating localized air quality data and health records, this research aims to identify whether increased smoke exposure correlates with adverse health effects. The specific research questions include:
 - Does wildfire smoke significantly affect respiratory health (COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis) outcomes in Madison?
 - Is there a relationship between wildfire smoke exposure and increased death rates from respiratory illnesses, particularly those linked to COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis?
 - What is the demand for hospitalization and emergency visits for asthma, COPD, TB in the upcoming years and how can healthcare providers prepare for this demand?

The study  hypothesizes that the increasing levels of smoke exposure correlate with a rise in respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations, and potentially mortality rates. If confirmed, it is expected for these trends to continue upward if smoke levels persist or increase in coming years. Based on the insights uncovered and the severity of any effects observed, we can then advise the Madison city council, city manager/mayor, and city residents on potential solutions to mitigate these health impacts.

#### Access Key
To use AQI related API we need to request a key using a valid email address. The EPA then sends a confirmation email link and a 'key' that we use for all other requests.
We only need to sign-up once, unless we want to invalidate the current key (by getting a new key) or we lose the key. Refer to the notebook [2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/ManasaSRonur/data-512-project/blob/main/2_aqi_data_acquisition.ipynb) for additional information.

### Limitations and Considerations.

- The Listed_fire_Dates includes all individual dates from merged datasets that overlap in the same area and year. This can provide more details but also adds variation and possible duplication, especially when multiple sources are involved making it unreliable.
- The tool used to measure fire distances works only with ring-shaped fire boundaries, so 36 fires with curve ring shapes failed while calculating distance and not included in analysis.
- An actual smoke impact would be based on wind direction over a course of several days, the intensity of the fire, and its duration and many other factor. However, the fire polygon data only (reliably) provide a year for each fire - it does not (reliably) provide specific start and end dates for the fire or the wind details.
- AQI value was missing for many records fetched through APIs, which were recalculated using the available pollutants data. This adds some level of uncertainity to the calculated value.
- AQI data is very sparse for years 2001 to 2009 leading poor qualirt average. This makes it difficult to compare and asses out calculation of smoke estimates for this period.
- The predictive model has R^2 value of only 0.71 which means the model explains about 71% of the variation in the data, there is still a lot of room for improvement in the model. Additionally the predicted values could be off by atleast 2 units which is significantly high for our scale of smoke estimates. While this is a fairly good model considering the data availability limitaion, this is not the best model to forecast the smoke estimate.
- Despite having access to smoke data spanning the last 60 years, a significant limitation is the relatively shorter temporal range of healthcare data, particularly hospitalization records, which are available only from 2000 to 2023 for asthma and COPD, and from 2014 - 2023 for TB. The lack of overlapping historical data limits our ability to examine the health impacts of smoke exposure with the same depth as our smoke data. Ideally, aligning both datasets temporally would have enabled a more comprehensive analysis.
- County-specific mortality rate data is unavailable, compelling us to use aggregate data for the entire state of Wisconsin. By relying on statewide data, we risk obscuring local trends and nuances in mortality that might otherwise reveal significant insights. This limitation could lead to correlation errors and impact the precision of our findings regarding the health effects of smoke specifically in Madison, Dane county.
- The extended model although seems effective, there is room to further improvement in the Asthma and COPD models, particularly by reducing RMSE through addiiton of more features and increasing overall size of training data.
- Other confounding variables, such as existing health conditions, dietary habits, exposure to toxic gases from other sources, etc., are not considered for forecasting the health indicators for future years. So this analysis alone might not provide an informed decision.
- The entire analysis in this notebook is based on wildfires in the USA, but Madison is constantly impacted by wildfires in Canada every year due to its geographical location. So we might miss the dominant contributors to poor air quality, leading to weaker than expected correlations with respiratory health trends.


### Conclusion

This study examined the impact of wildfire smoke on respiratory health outcomes in Madison, Wisconsin, with the hypothesis that increasing levels of smoke exposure correlate with a rise in respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations, and potentially mortality rates, particularly for asthma, COPD, and tuberculosis. The findings strongly support this hypothesis, revealing a significant positive correlation between smoke exposure and the incidence of asthma and COPD. While the relationship between smoke and tuberculosis was less pronounced, COPD mortality showed a notable connection to smoke levels, whereas asthma and tuberculosis mortality were more influenced by systemic factors such as healthcare access and preexisting conditions. Projections suggest a steep rise in respiratory illnesses over the coming decades if current trends in wildfire smoke continue unabated.

Beyond the statistical findings, this study exemplifies how data science can serve as a bridge between complex environmental data and real-world health outcomes. It underscores the importance of ethical considerations and a human-centered approach, ensuring that the research is not only robust but also aligned with the broader goal of improving quality of life. The conclusions offer valuable guidance for policymakers, healthcare providers, and urban planners in developing strategies such as enhancing air quality monitoring systems, preparing healthcare infrastructure for increased respiratory care demand, and raising public awareness about protective measures. This research reaffirms the potential of data-driven approaches to foster equitable, informed, and community-focused responses to pressing public health challenges.
